Chart.js is a great starting point for interactive data visualization. One idea is to build a Chart.js playground where users can select different chart types (like bar, line, or pie), dynamically adjust data points, and see how the chart updates in real time. We could structure it as follows:

• Create a simple web app with a two-pane layout. 
• Single HTML File with your suggested interesting theme and embedded custom JavaScript.
• The left pane could let users choose the chart type and adjust data via form controls. 
• The right pane would display the chart rendered by Chart.js (using a library like react-chartjs-2 for easy integration). 
• We could even add features like custom color selection, axis configuration, or live data updates.

This interactive playground would not only demonstrate Chart.js’s capabilities but also provide a hands-on learning experience.
