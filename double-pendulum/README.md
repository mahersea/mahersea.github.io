# Double Pendulum Chaos Visualization

An interactive physics simulation demonstrating the chaotic behavior of a double pendulum system.

## About
This project implements the full equations of motion for a double pendulum, a classic example of a simple system with chaotic behavior. Small changes in initial conditions lead to vastly different trajectories over time.

## Features
- Accurate physics simulation based on differential equations
- Motion trail visualization showing chaotic patterns
- Real-time animation showing sensitivity to initial conditions
