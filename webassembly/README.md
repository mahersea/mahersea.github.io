# WebAssembly Introduction

An interactive demonstration of WebAssembly fundamentals, showcasing how to load and execute WASM code from JavaScript.

## Description

This project provides a simple but comprehensive introduction to WebAssembly. It features a binary WASM module that implements an addition function, along with a user interface for providing inputs and visualizing the result. The application also includes theme toggling functionality to demonstrate UI integration with WebAssembly computation.

## Features

- Hand-crafted WebAssembly binary module
- Interactive input fields for function parameters
- Canvas visualization of computation results
- Multiple theme options (light, dark, high contrast, low contrast)
- Responsive layout with sidebar controls
- Direct WebAssembly instantiation and execution

## Technical Details

The implementation includes:
1. Raw WebAssembly binary code definition
2. Asynchronous module compilation and instantiation
3. JavaScript-to-WebAssembly function calling
4. Canvas-based result visualization
5. CSS variable-based theming system
6. Error handling for WebAssembly operations
