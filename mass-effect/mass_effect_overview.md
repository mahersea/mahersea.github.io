# Mass Effect Overview

## General Overview

**Mass Effect** is a science-fiction role-playing game (RPG) series
developed by **BioWare** and first released in **2007**. It blends
**third-person shooting mechanics** with **role-playing systems**,
dialogue trees, and branching storylines. The games are set in a richly
detailed galaxy full of alien species, political intrigue, and advanced
technology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting

The series takes place in the late 22nd century. Humanity has discovered
**mass relays**, ancient devices left behind by a precursor race called
the **Protheans**, which allow for faster-than-light travel between star
systems. This leads humanity into contact with a larger community of
alien civilizations, organized under the **Citadel Council**.

The galaxy is filled with diverse species, such as the militaristic
**Turians**, scholarly **Asari**, merchant-like **Volus**, and many
more. Technology, politics, and war are influenced heavily by the legacy
of these ancient civilizations.

## Full Trilogy Plot Summary (Spoilers Ahead!)

### Mass Effect (2007)

Commander Shepard uncovers that the rogue Spectre **Saren** is working
with a machine race called the **Reapers**, who cyclically annihilate
advanced civilizations. Using an army of synthetic **Geth**, Saren tries
to bring about the Reapers' return. Shepard unites allies across
species, confronts Saren, and prevents the Reapers' immediate
invasion---though the greater threat remains.

### Mass Effect 2 (2010)

Shepard is killed early in the game but resurrected by **Cerberus**, a
human-focused paramilitary group, to combat a new threat: the
**Collectors**, who are abducting human colonies. Shepard must recruit
and build loyalty among a diverse team for a final "suicide mission"
against the Collectors, who are revealed to be working for the Reapers.
With enough preparation, Shepard can save the entire crew.

### Mass Effect 3 (2012)

The Reapers launch a full-scale invasion of the galaxy. Shepard must
unite the fractured civilizations to form a galaxy-wide resistance.
Choices from the previous games influence alliances, resources, and who
survives. Shepard ultimately confronts the Reapers at Earth, facing a
final choice that determines the fate of organic and synthetic life in
the galaxy.
