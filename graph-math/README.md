# Graph Theory Visualization

An interactive tool for exploring mathematical graph structures and algorithms.

## About
This project provides a visual interface for creating and manipulating graphs (nodes and edges) while demonstrating fundamental concepts and algorithms from graph theory. It helps build intuition about graph properties and the behavior of common graph algorithms.

## Features
- Interactive graph creation and editing
- Support for both directed and undirected graphs
- Visual representation of graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Shortest path finding using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Minimum spanning tree visualization
- Graph properties calculation (connectivity, cycles, etc.)

## Mathematical Concepts
The visualization demonstrates key graph theory concepts including:
- Vertex and edge relationships
- Graph traversal and search algorithms
- Path optimization problems
- Connectivity and component analysis
- Various graph properties and metrics
