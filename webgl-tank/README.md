# Tank Game with Opposing Forces

A 3D tank battle game with bunker defense, mortar strikes, and health management built using Three.js.

## Description

This 3D tank combat simulator puts players in control of a military tank on a battlefield filled with enemy bunkers and strategic challenges. The game features a physics-based movement system with realistic acceleration, deceleration, and steering mechanics, along with a dynamic weapon system that allows players to fire projectiles at enemy targets. 

Enemy bunkers actively defend themselves by firing at the player, while periodic mortar strikes rain down from above, creating an intense and varied combat experience. The game includes a health and scoring system, along with special medic bunkers that appear periodically to allow players to restore their tank's health. Visual effects include particle explosions, shock waves, muzzle flashes, and lighting that enhance the immersive battlefield atmosphere.
