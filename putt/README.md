# Putt Golf Game

A minimalist, physics-based mini golf simulation with simple but engaging gameplay mechanics.

## Description

This compact browser-based golf game simulates the experience of putting on a circular green. Players use drag-and-release mechanics to control the direction and power of their shots, aiming to sink the ball into a randomly positioned hole on the green. The game features realistic physics including momentum, friction, and collision detection with the edge of the green.

With its clean, minimalist design and straightforward gameplay, the Putt Golf Game focuses on the essential elements that make golf games satisfying: the strategic adjustment of shot power and angle, the physical response of the ball on the green, and the moment of satisfaction when the ball drops into the hole. The game resets with a new hole position after each successful putt, providing endless replayability.
