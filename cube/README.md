# 3D Interactive Cube with Nodes and Vectors

A Three.js visualization showing a 3D cube with dynamic nodes and connecting vectors.

## About
This project creates an interactive 3D cube with nodes positioned at each face's center. Colored vectors connect these nodes to the cube's center, creating a visually interesting representation of 3D space and vectors.

## Features
- 3D cube with different colored faces
- Interactive orbit controls for rotation and zoom
- Nodes positioned at the center of each face
- Colored vectors showing connections between nodes and center
- Mouse-controlled rotation for intuitive interaction
