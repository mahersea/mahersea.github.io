# Responsive Thumbnails with Arrows

An interactive thumbnail gallery demonstration with SVG arrows connecting thumbnails to a central element, maintaining responsive design at different screen sizes.

## Description

This project showcases a pattern for creating responsive image galleries with visual connections between elements. It maintains precise positioning of thumbnails and connection lines regardless of screen size, using a fixed aspect ratio container and SVG overlays.

## Features

- Responsive design with preserved aspect ratios
- SVG arrow connections between thumbnails
- Interactive thumbnail previews
- Fixed position elements within a flexible container

## Technical Details

The implementation uses:
1. CSS aspect-ratio property to maintain the design canvas dimensions
2. SVG overlay with a fixed viewBox for scalable arrows and connections
3. Absolute positioning with precise coordinates relative to the design space
4. JavaScript for handling thumbnail interactions and image previews
