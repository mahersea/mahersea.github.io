# Cat Behavior Simulation

An interactive simulation of feline behavior patterns in a home environment, visualizing how cats interact with their surroundings over time.

## Description

This application uses Two.js to create a time-based simulation of cat behavior, tracking movement patterns, biological needs, and interactions with key environmental elements like food, water, and litter boxes. The simulation demonstrates how cats naturally manage their day and how their environment changes over time.

## Features

- Multiple cat simulation with unique behaviors
- Time-based needs simulation (feeding, hydration, waste elimination)
- Interactive environment with stations for food, water, and litter
- Time controls (pause, speed, reset)
- Visual feedback on station usage levels
- Random behavioral patterns influenced by realistic cat needs
- Animated movement with natural wander patterns

## Technical Details

The simulation leverages:
1. Two.js for vector graphics rendering
2. Object-oriented design for cat and station entities
3. Gaussian random functions for natural movement patterns
4. Time-based state management for needs and behaviors
5. Responsive canvas sizing
6. Interactive controls for simulation parameters
