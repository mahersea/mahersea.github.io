- Good basic task management with CRUD operations
- Project and user association for tasks
- Organized code structure with clear API endpoints
- Lightweight and fast-loading

### Areas for Improvement
- Limited styling and brand identity
- Basic error handling without user feedback
- No data visualization (like Gantt charts)
- Limited task metadata and filtering
- No authentication or user permissions
- Lacks mobile responsiveness

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (1-2 weeks)
- ✅ Implement brand style guide (colors, typography, UI elements)
- ✅ Add robust error handling and empty states
- ✅ Implement Gantt chart for task visualization
- Add responsive design for mobile devices
- Add task filtering and sorting capabilities

### Phase 2: Enhanced Task Management (2-3 weeks)
- Add task priorities (High, Medium, Low)
- Implement task categories/tags
- Add task comments/activity logging
- Create dashboard with summary statistics
- Add task search functionality
- Implement data export (CSV, JSON)

### Phase 3: User Experience (3-4 weeks)
- Add user authentication system
- Implement user roles and permissions
- Add email notifications for task deadlines
- Create user profile pages
- Implement task templates
- Add drag-and-drop task reordering

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (4+ weeks)
- Time tracking for tasks
- Recurring tasks
- File attachments for tasks
- Team collaboration features
- Integrations with external services (calendar, email)
- Public API for third-party integrations

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement brand styling from the style guide
2. Update error handling for empty files and API errors
3. Integrate Gantt chart view for timeline visualization
4. Add responsive design for mobile compatibility

### Technical Debt to Address
- Add automated testing suite
- Implement input validation on all forms
- Create proper documentation
- Optimize file operations for larger datasets
- Implement proper database instead of JSON files

## User-Focused Enhancements
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Bulk actions for tasks (multi-select, change status)
- Customizable views and layouts
- User onboarding experience/tutorial
- Dark mode option

## Long-term Vision
LittleTaskMan aims to become a lightweight but powerful project management tool for small teams and individuals. The focus will remain on simplicity and ease of use while gradually adding more powerful features that don't overwhelm the user experience.

Unlike larger enterprise solutions, LittleTaskMan will prioritize speed, minimal configuration, and intuitive design while still providing the core functionality needed for effective task and project management.
