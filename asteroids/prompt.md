You are an expert web developer tasked with building a complete, self-contained version of the classic game "Asteroids" in a single file. The game should meet the following requirements:

1. **Visual Style:**  
   - The game should have a classic, minimalist black and white design.

2. **Gameplay Mechanics:**  
   - The player's spaceship (rocket) should be able to spin in place.
   - Pressing the space bar should propel the spaceship, allowing it to traverse an asteroid field.
   - The game world is "closed" vertically: when the spaceship moves off the top edge of the screen, it reappears at the bottom.

3. **Special Feature – Hyper-Space:**  
   - Implement a hyper-space feature (triggered by an additional key, such as 'H') that instantly teleports the spaceship to a random location on the screen.

4. **Technology & Implementation:**  
   - Use either HTML5 Canvas or WebGL for rendering the game, ensuring the approach is as portable as possible.
   - All assets and resources should be embedded or local, with no external dependencies.
   - The entire game should be contained in one single HTML file.

5. **User Interface:**  
   - Display game instructions (controls and objectives) clearly in the top right corner of the screen.

Please generate the complete code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for this game. Ensure the code is well-organized and commented, so that it’s easy to understand and modify.
