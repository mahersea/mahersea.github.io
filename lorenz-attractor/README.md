# Lorenz Attractor Visualization

An interactive visualization of the famous Lorenz chaotic system that demonstrates the "butterfly effect".

## About
This simulation shows the Lorenz system, a set of ordinary differential equations whose solution exhibits chaotic behavior. The Lorenz attractor demonstrates sensitive dependence on initial conditions - a key concept in chaos theory often called the "butterfly effect".

## Features
- Real-time integration of the Lorenz equations using Euler's method
- Color-coded trail visualization showing the system's trajectory
- Adjustable time step parameter to control simulation speed
- Option to toggle trail fading for different visual effects
