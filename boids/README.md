# Boids Simulation

An interactive implementation of Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm, demonstrating emergent flocking behavior through simple rules.

## About
This simulation shows how complex, lifelike flocking patterns emerge from three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. Each autonomous agent ("boid") follows these rules to create realistic group movement patterns.

## Features
- Adjustable parameters for separation, alignment, and cohesion
- Dynamic coloring based on neighbor proximity
- Interactive controls to modify simulation behavior
