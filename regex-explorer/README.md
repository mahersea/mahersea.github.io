# Regex Explorer

An interactive tool for exploring, testing, and understanding regular expressions with practical examples.

## Description

This application provides an accessible playground for experimenting with regular expressions (regex) in a user-friendly environment. Users can select from a variety of pre-defined regex patterns for common use cases like email validation, URL matching, and date formatting, or create their own custom patterns to test against sample text.

The tool features a split-pane interface with a regex pattern display, detailed explanation of the selected pattern, and a testing area where users can input text to see matching results in real-time. Each regex example comes with a comprehensive explanation of how the pattern works, making it educational for both beginners and experienced developers looking to refine their regex skills.
