# Multi-Quadrant Explosion Simulation with Raga Tones

An interactive audio-visual experience combining particle explosions with musical elements from traditional ragas.

## Description

This application creates a unique sensory experience by pairing visual particle explosions with musical tones based on Indian ragas. The interface is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different sonic and visual space. Users can manipulate parameters for each quadrant independently or globally, creating a harmonious relationship between visual movement and sound.

## Features

- Quadrant-based interface with four independent simulation areas
- Particle explosion effects with customizable parameters
- Audio synthesis based on traditional Indian raga scales
- Global and local control panels for parameter adjustment
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Real-time audio-visual synchronization
- Dark aesthetic design for enhanced visual contrast
- Independent sound parameters for each quadrant

## Technical Details

The implementation utilizes:
1. Canvas API for particle rendering and animation
2. Web Audio API for tone generation and synthesis
3. CSS Grid for responsive quadrant layout
4. Event-driven parameter controls
5. Particle physics simulation
6. Musical theory principles for raga tone selection
7. Dynamic audio parameter mapping
