# Gridout: Interactive Particle System

A generative art experiment using particle systems with gravitational interactions and emergent patterns.

## About
Gridout creates mesmerizing visual patterns through simulated physics. Particles interact based on gravitational-like attraction, creating organic movement and emergent behavior when users interact with the system.

## Features
- Particles become attractors on mouse interaction
- Explosion and orbit mechanics based on adjustable physics parameters
- Dynamic visual patterns that evolve based on user input
