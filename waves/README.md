# Waveform Visualizations

An interactive exploration of various wave types and their mathematical properties.

## About
This project provides visual demonstrations of different types of waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle) and how they combine to create complex signals. It helps build intuition about wave physics, signal processing, and harmonic analysis.

## Features
- Multiple waveform types to compare and contrast
- Interactive controls to adjust frequency, amplitude, and phase
- Visual representation of waveform evolution over time
- Optional harmonic analysis showing frequency components
- Smooth animations with customizable parameters

## Physics & Mathematics
The visualizations demonstrate key wave concepts including:
- Simple harmonic motion
- Wave superposition
- Frequency relationships
- Phase differences
- Harmonic content in non-sinusoidal waves
