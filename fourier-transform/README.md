# Fourier Series Visualization

An interactive demonstration of how Fourier series can approximate different waveforms by adding harmonics.

## About
This visualization shows how adding sinusoidal terms of different frequencies (harmonics) can create complex waveforms like square, sawtooth, and triangle waves. The animation displays both the rotating vectors (epicycles) and the resulting waveform.

## Features
- Switch between square, sawtooth, and triangle wave approximations
- Adjust the number of harmonics (terms) in the series
- Real-time visualization of the epicycle construction
- Pause/resume animation control
