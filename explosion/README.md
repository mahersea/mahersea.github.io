# Particle Explosion Effect Module

A reusable JavaScript module for creating dynamic particle explosion animations.

## About
This project provides a customizable particle explosion effect that can be easily integrated into web applications and games. The module creates realistic, physics-based explosions with configurable parameters for particle count, speed, colors, and behavior.

## Features
- Configurable explosion parameters (size, duration, intensity)
- Realistic physics with gravity and air resistance
- Customizable particle appearance with colors and shapes
- Multiple explosion types (radial, directional, implosion)
- Smooth animation with proper timing and frame rate handling

## Implementation
The explosion effect is created using the following techniques:
- Canvas-based rendering for optimal performance
- Particle system with individual particle physics
- Velocity and acceleration modeling
- Alpha blending for smooth fade-out
- Optimization for handling many particles simultaneously
