# Flowing Pixels Animation

A mesmerizing generative art visualization with interactive pixel flows and emergent patterns.

## About
This project creates a dynamic, continuously evolving field of flowing pixels that respond to user interaction. The pixels follow fluid-like motion patterns and create emergent structures, resulting in a visually engaging abstract artwork.

## Features
- Particles that flow according to simulated vector fields
- Interactive response to mouse movement and clicks
- Dynamic color transformations based on particle properties
- Smooth animation with alpha-blending for motion trails
- Adjustable parameters for speed and visual density

## Techniques
The animation uses several techniques from generative art and computational design:
- Perlin noise for natural-looking motion patterns
- Particle systems for emergent behavior
- Vector field visualization principles
- Alpha blending for creating motion trails
