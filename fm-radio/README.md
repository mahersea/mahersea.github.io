# FM Tower Broadcast Simulation

An interactive visualization of FM radio wave propagation from a broadcast tower.

## Description

This simulation demonstrates how FM radio waves propagate from a transmission tower across a landscape. The application visualizes the emission of radio frequency waves, their expansion through space, and their interaction with the environment. Users can adjust frequency, broadcast power, and wave speed to observe different propagation behaviors.

## Features

- Animated visualization of FM radio wave propagation
- Adjustable frequency range (88-108 MHz)
- Controllable broadcast power settings
- Variable wave speed for simulation time control
- Play/pause animation capability
- Realistic landscape with trees for scale reference
- Visual representation of the broadcast tower and antenna
- Wave opacity changes based on distance and power

## Technical Details

The implementation utilizes:
1. HTML5 Canvas for all rendering
2. Animation frame-based rendering loop
3. Physics-based wave propagation modeling
4. Interactive controls using range inputs
5. Dynamic opacity calculation based on wave age and power
6. Scenery elements for contextual visualization
