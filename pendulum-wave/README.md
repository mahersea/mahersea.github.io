# Pendulum Wave Simulation

A physics-based visualization of the pendulum wave effect demonstrating principles of simple harmonic motion.

## About
This simulation creates a mesmerizing wave-like pattern by synchronizing multiple pendulums of slightly different lengths. Due to the mathematical relationship between a pendulum's length and its period, the pendulums gradually shift in and out of phase with each other, creating visual wave patterns.

## Features
- Array of pendulums with incrementally increasing lengths
- Color-coded pendulums for easier visual tracking
- Physics-based motion simulation using the simple pendulum equation
- Adjustable animation speed control
- Pause/resume functionality

## Physics
This simulation uses the small-angle approximation for simple pendulum motion:
- Angular frequency: É = (g/L) where g is gravitational acceleration and L is pendulum length
- Position as a function of time: ¸(t) = ¸€ × cos(Ét) where ¸€ is the maximum angle
