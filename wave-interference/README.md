# Wave Interference Visualization

An interactive simulation demonstrating the principle of wave interference from multiple sources.

## About
This visualization shows how waves from multiple sources interfere to create complex patterns. It's based on the superposition principle where waves from different sources combine by adding their amplitudes at each point in space.

## Features
- Place wave sources anywhere on the canvas by clicking
- Adjustable wavelength and speed parameters
- Resolution scaling for performance optimization
- Preset configurations for classical interference experiments
- Real-time computation and rendering of interference patterns
