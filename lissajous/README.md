# Lissajous Curve Visualization

An animated visualization of Lissajous curves, the beautiful patterns created by combining two perpendicular harmonic oscillations.

## About
This project demonstrates Lissajous curves, which are formed when two sinusoidal motions at right angles are combined. The specific pattern depends on the frequency ratio and phase difference between the two oscillations.

## Features
- Smooth animation of a point tracing the Lissajous pattern
- Colorful trail showing the curve's construction over time
- Adjustable animation speed for different viewing experiences
- Option to toggle trail fading for different visual effects
