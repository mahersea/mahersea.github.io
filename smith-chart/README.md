# Antenna & Smith Chart Visualization

An interactive visualization of antenna radiation patterns and impedance using the Smith Chart with real-time controls.

## Description

This application provides a dynamic visualization of antenna behavior and impedance characteristics using the Smith Chart, a graphical tool widely used in RF engineering. The visualization features an animated antenna radiation pattern with propagating wavefronts and a moving impedance point that demonstrates how impedance changes over time.

The Smith Chart portion displays constant resistance circles and reactance arcs, providing a complete representation of complex impedance. Users can control various parameters including animation speed, antenna length, and impedance offset through an intuitive UI. The visualization helps demonstrate key concepts in RF engineering and antenna theory, making abstract electromagnetic concepts more tangible and interactive.
