# Euler's Identity Visualizer

An interactive mathematical visualization exploring the beautiful relationship in Euler's identity: e^(i¿) + 1 = 0.

## About
This project visually demonstrates how complex exponentials, trigonometric functions, and the unit circle interrelate in Euler's identity - often called the most beautiful equation in mathematics.

## Features
- Multiple visualization modes (unit circle, complex plane, spiral)
- Interactive controls to explore different values and relationships
- Visual representation of how e^(i∏) relates to cos(∏) and sin(∏)
