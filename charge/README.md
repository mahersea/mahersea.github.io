# Capacitor Charge Simulation

An interactive visualization of RC circuit charging and discharging behavior, demonstrating fundamental electronics principles.

## About
This simulation illustrates how a capacitor charges and discharges in an RC circuit, showing the exponential nature of these processes. Press to charge, release to discharge.

## Features
- Real-time voltage-time graph
- Color-coded charging and discharging phases
- Interactive charge/discharge control with mouse input
