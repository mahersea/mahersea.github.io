# AI Pathfinding Experiments

A comparative demonstration of pathfinding implementations using the A* algorithm, created by different AI systems.

## Description

This project showcases implementations of the A* pathfinding algorithm created by various AI systems (Claude and ChatGPT). It demonstrates how different AI models approach the same problem of finding optimal paths in a grid-based environment. The implementations use vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas to visualize the pathfinding process.

## Features

- Multiple implementations of the A* pathfinding algorithm
- Interactive grid-based pathfinding visualization
- Comparative analysis of AI-generated code solutions
- Clear explanation of algorithmic concepts
- Visual representation of open/closed sets and found paths
- Performance metrics and comparisons
- Canvas-based rendering of pathfinding process
- Educational resource for understanding pathfinding algorithms

## Technical Details

The implementations demonstrate:
1. The A* algorithm core mechanics (open set, closed set, heuristics)
2. Grid-based environment representation
3. Different heuristic functions (Manhattan, Euclidean)
4. Path reconstruction techniques
5. Performance optimization approaches
6. Canvas-based visualization of the algorithm's steps
7. Various ways to handle obstacles and terrain
