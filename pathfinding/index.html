    <h2>AI Pathfinding Experiments</h2>
    <img src="pathfinder-medium.png" alt="Pathfinding Visualization" width="100" height="100">
    <p>These are some experiments with AI pathfinding using the A* algorithm. The code is generated as vanilla JavaScript and uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering.</p>
    <p>The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is widely used in many fields of computer science due to its performance and accuracy. 
       The A* algorithm finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node by combining the cost to reach the node and an estimate of the cost to reach the goal from that node.</p>
    <p>In the following examples, we will explore how the A* algorithm works in practice with a simple code examples.</p>

    <h3>Prompt:</h3>
    <p>Using the A* algorithm, JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, describe how path finding works and provide a simple code example</p>
