# Irrational Pi Visualization

An animated visualization of the complex function z(∏) = e^(i∏) + e^(i¿∏), showing beautiful patterns derived from ¿.

## About
This project creates a mesmerizing visualization that explores the relationship between e (Euler's number), i (the imaginary unit), and ¿ (pi). It shows how combining these mathematical constants through complex exponentiation creates beautiful patterns in the complex plane.

## Features
- Real-time animation of the complex-valued function z(∏) = e^(i∏) + e^(i¿∏)
- Colorful trails showing the path traced by the function in the complex plane
- Displays both the point path and connecting lines to the origin
- Dynamic coloring based on the angle parameter
- Smooth animation with adjustable speed

## Mathematical Significance
This visualization demonstrates:
- How e^(i∏) traces the unit circle in the complex plane (Euler's formula)
- The effect of combining e^(i∏) with e^(i¿∏), where ¿ creates interesting harmonic patterns
- The transcendental and irrational nature of ¿ visualized through complex patterns
