# Interactive Sound Buttons with Pitch Variation

A musical exploration tool with color-coded sound buttons featuring progressively deeper pitch and brightness variations.

## Description

This interactive audio application creates a visual and auditory experience through a matrix of color-coded sound buttons. Each button produces a specific musical note when activated, with rows representing different pitch ranges organized in a raga-like structure. The interface presents multiple rows of sound buttons, with each successive row offering deeper, darker tones both visually and aurally.

The application applies systematic pitch reduction and color darkening as users move through the button rows, creating a coherent relationship between visual appearance and sonic character. A random word generator at the top of the interface adds an element of serendipity, potentially inspiring creative sound explorations or meditative experiences as users interact with the various tones.

## Features
