# Portfolio of Interactive Web Projects

A collection of interactive web-based experiments, visualizations, and applications showcasing various technologies and concepts.

## Description

This repository contains a diverse set of web projects spanning multiple domains including mathematics, physics, game development, web design, data visualization, and creative coding. Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README.md file with details about the implementation and technologies used.

## Project Categories

- **Games**: Interactive experiences from simple arcade-style games to more complex simulations
- **Visualizations**: Data visualizations, mathematical concepts, and physics simulations
- **Tools**: Utilities and applications for web design, layout, and learning
- **Experiments**: Creative coding projects exploring novel ideas and techniques

## Technical Implementation

The projects in this portfolio are primarily built using:

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Canvas and SVG for graphics
- Various libraries including Chart.js, D3.js, Two.js, and others
- Modern web technologies such as WebAssembly, WebGL, and CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Node.js for server components when required
