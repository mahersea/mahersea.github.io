# Interactive Image Puzzle

A customizable jigsaw-style puzzle game with variable difficulty levels and solving assistance.

## Description

This interactive puzzle game allows users to solve jigsaw-style puzzles created from random images. The application slices a source image into a grid of pieces, then randomly scatters them across the canvas for the player to rearrange. Players can drag and drop individual puzzle pieces, with visual feedback helping them identify when a piece is close to its correct position.

The game features variable difficulty levels, allowing players to select the number of puzzle pieces (from 100 up to 1000), making it suitable for casual players and puzzle enthusiasts alike. The interface includes a clean grid system that helps players visualize where pieces should be placed, and provides options to restart the puzzle or automatically solve it when players need assistance.
