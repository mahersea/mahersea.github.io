# Foerster Fractal Visualization

An interactive fractal tree visualization with adjustable parameters for exploring recursive branching patterns.

## Description

This application renders a fractal tree (also known as a Foerster fractal) using recursive drawing techniques. It demonstrates how simple rules can create complex, natural-looking patterns through iteration. Users can adjust the branch angle and recursion depth to explore different fractal configurations and observe how these parameters affect the resulting structure.

## Features

- Interactive controls for branch angle and recursion depth
- Real-time visual updates when parameters are changed
- Color gradient based on branch depth for visual distinction
- Line width variation based on branch level
- Smooth rendering on HTML5 Canvas
- Intuitive user interface with sliders and value displays
- Visually appealing color transitions from red to green

## Technical Details

The implementation utilizes:
1. Recursive drawing algorithm for branch generation
2. HSL color mapping based on recursive depth
3. Trigonometric calculations for branch positioning
4. Dynamic line width based on branch level
5. Parameter mapping from user inputs to visual properties
6. Event listeners for interactive controls
