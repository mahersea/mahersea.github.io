# Interactive Drifting Squares

A falling block game with a spaceship defender, featuring orbital rotation mechanics and a clean visual aesthetic.

## Description

Gridout v2 is an engaging browser-based game where players control a spaceship to destroy falling geometric blocks before they stack too high. The game combines elements of classic arcade shooters with a unique rotating block mechanic, creating a compelling challenge as players must shoot down or navigate around the constantly rotating obstacles.

Each block has a distinct randomly-generated shape that rotates as it falls, requiring strategic positioning and timing to destroy. The game includes special features like a bouncing ball that periodically enters play, and torpedoes that can be fired to destroy blocks.

## Features
