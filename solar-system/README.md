# Solar System Simulation

An interactive, aesthetically pleasing simulation of our solar system with planets, asteroids, and comets.

## About
This project creates a simplified model of our solar system, including all eight planets with realistic relative sizes and orbital periods. It also features an asteroid belt and comets with highly elliptical orbits.

## Features
- All eight planets with appropriate relative sizes and orbital periods
- Asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter with randomized orbits
- Comets with elliptical orbits and realistic tails pointing away from the Sun
- Adjustable simulation speed and toggles for orbit paths and labels
- Visually appealing gradients and lighting effects
