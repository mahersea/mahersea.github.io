# Ohm's Law Interactive Visualizer

An advanced interactive visualization tool for exploring the relationships between voltage, current, resistance, and power in electrical circuits.

## Description

This application offers an intuitive interface for understanding and visualizing Ohm's Law and related electrical concepts. Users can dynamically control two electrical parameters (voltage, current, resistance, or power) via sliders while the application calculates and displays the remaining values in real-time.

The visualizer features a clean, modern interface with an animated circuit diagram that responds to user inputs, allowing users to see how changing one parameter affects others. The highlight of the application is the interactive Ohm's Law wheel, which visually represents the mathematical relationships between all four electrical parameters, with contextual highlighting based on which parameters are being controlled.

## Features

- Dynamic control of any two electrical parameters (V, I, R, P) with immediate calculation of related values
- Interactive circuit diagram that changes appearance based on power values
- Animated Ohm's Law wheel showcasing all formulations of Ohm's Law
- Visual contextual highlighting of relevant formulas based on user's parameter selection
- Real-time warning system for extreme electrical values
- Slick dark-mode interface optimized for learning electrical concepts
- Responsive value displays with appropriate units (V, A, ©, W)
- Canvas-based graphics with smooth animations

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS
- Uses HTML5 Canvas for drawing circuit diagrams and formula wheel
- Implements dynamic contextual UI that updates based on user selection
