# Retro Racer - Best of 11

A retro-styled light cycle racing game featuring player versus computer in a best-of-11 series with progressive difficulty.

## Description

Retro Racer is a nostalgic arcade racing game inspired by classic light cycle competitions from the 1980s. Players control a neon vehicle that leaves a persistent trail behind it, competing against an AI opponent in a best-of-11 series. The goal is simple: avoid collisions with either racer's trail while trying to maneuver your opponent into a crash.

What makes this game unique is its progressive difficulty system - as players advance through the 11-game series, both the speed increases and the visual appearance of the racers transforms, with colors shifting from cool neon tones to warmer hues. The AI opponent employs a lookahead algorithm that scans for potential dangers and makes increasingly strategic decisions, creating a challenging yet fair gameplay experience.
