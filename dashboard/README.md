# Spaceship Dashboard

A visual simulation of spaceship control panels using multiple canvas elements and dynamic visualizations.

## Description

This project creates a futuristic spaceship dashboard display using multiple canvas elements to render different components: wave patterns, grid displays, and explosion effects. The combined visualizations create an immersive control panel experience with dynamic animations and interactive elements.

## Features

- Multi-canvas layout for separate visualization components
- Wave pattern generator for signal displays
- Grid system for position or radar tracking
- Explosion module for alert or weapon systems simulation
- Black background with high-contrast elements for visibility
- Modular architecture with independent visualization components

## Technical Details

The implementation utilizes:
1. Multiple HTML5 canvas elements for concurrent visualizations
2. Modular JavaScript files for independent components
3. Animation loops for dynamic visual effects
4. Flexible layout for different screen sizes
5. External module imports for component reuse
