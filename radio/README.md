# Simple Sound Player

A straightforward web-based sound player for looping and testing audio samples.

## Description

This application provides a minimal interface for playing, looping, and testing audio samples from a web browser. The player features a collection of preloaded button sounds that can be toggled on and off individually, allowing users to experiment with layering different sounds simultaneously.

The interface offers simple controls for each sound, with buttons that toggle between play and mute states. Users can create impromptu sound combinations by activating multiple sounds at once, with each sample playing in a continuous loop until stopped. A dedicated test button is also provided for quickly checking audio functionality without engaging the looping behavior.
